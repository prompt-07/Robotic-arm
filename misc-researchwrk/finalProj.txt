A robot arm has a mechanical structure that alters
its form using a group of electric motors like 
servo motors or hydraulic actuators.

Roll-Pitch-Yaw

The AIY Voice Kit from Google lets you build your own
natural language processor and connect it to the
Google Assistant or Cloud its simply Speech-to-Text
service, allowing you to ask questions and
issue voice  commands to your programs and is 
powered by a Raspberry Pi.

it is usually used to achive home/work smart asistant
such as alexa/siri but here we have modified it to achieve 
our goals to have speech to txt conversion.

Step 1: 
Preparing servos we make sure all are placed 90deg 
across the axis which dof is to be achieved
connect the wheel to all servos except the gripper
 
Step 2:
Assemble the base and connect each motor to its respective 
aluminium plate

Step 3:
Assemble the shoulder by connecting the shoulder servo 
to the arm

Step 4:
Assemble the elbow and connect the elbow to the arm
we assembled in Step 3.

Step 5:
Assembling the wrist the wrist has two movements—pitch and
rotate and they require two servos and consequently two
servo brackets

Step 6:
Assembling the gripper it contains a very simple movement—it
opens and closes—so only one servo is necessary

Step 7:
Assembling the base you need to set the robot arm in
a base made of wood, metal.

Summary

With rapid growth in Opensource
one is left with plenty of options when building
a project . As this robotic arm
is cloud based and is closest clone to human arm
therefore this model has an upper
hand over other models.Previous versions
tend to be non-existent in the mere future and
therefore they may be just a part of ewaste.
This model has a potential to meet present requirements
and update uninterruptedly in order to achieve future goals.


Foremost, we would like to express my deepest thanks to our
project guide Prof. Rupali, for her endless guidance and 
time her patience, encouragement, and immense knowledge 
were key motivations throughout the project.
